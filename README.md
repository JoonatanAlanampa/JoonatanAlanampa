## Hi there 👋

My name is Joonatan, and I hold a Bachelor of Science (Technology). I'm currently pursuing a master's degree with a major in SoC design

- Working on system-level development of video streaming setup; an HLS matrix-multiplication project with Siemens Catapult; and the ASIC RTL-to-GDSII flow.
- Learning all things SoC-related.
- Seeking a SoC-focused internship or junior developer role. Also interested in SoC related thesis worker positions.
